Source License
--------------

The Tilkynna project uses multiple licenses for the various project repositories.  

- The [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) is used by most repositories for [code](https://github.com/GrindrodBank/tilkynna/). 
- The [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License (CC-BY)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) is used for [documentation](https://github.com/GrindrodBank/tilkynna/blob/master/doc/). 

Binary License
--------------

Tilkynna distributions are licensed with a variety of licenses, dependent on the content. By default, the MIT license is used, the exact same as the [source license](https://github.com/GrindrodBank/tilkynna/blob/master/LICENSE), with the same copyright holder. 

The following rules are used for determining the binary license:

- Tilkynna binary distributions (docker images, zips, maven packages, â€¦) are licensed as MIT (identical to the [tilkynna source license](https://github.com/GrindrodBank/tilkynna/blob/master/LICENSE)).
- It is OK for the source and binary licenses not to match. For example, the source might be Apache 2 but ships as an MIT binary.  The third party notices file should capture the Apache 2 license. This only works for a permissive licenses, however, we have limited the project to that class of licenses already. The value of this approach is that binary licenses are uniform.
